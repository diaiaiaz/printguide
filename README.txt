This is a guide on how to print a booklet for cheap/ free. 
They are applicable to students at Glasgow School of Art.
You can write a version yourself that is applicable to designers working in the same context as you. To distribute print out and leave in the printers in your school or area. 


First you will need to source materials. 

You can order paper samples from many suppliers.

Munken by Arctic Paper is a good paper supplier. You can order 20 A4 sheets at a time. However, they print their logo in the bottom right hand corner. You should therefore design your page to fit within 250x210mm. If saddle stitching, two pages must fit within this space. 

GF Smith are another paper supplier you can order samples from. When requesting samples do not state that you are an art student as they will tell you to look at the paper sample books your school is supplied with. Instead describe yourself as a freelance graphic designer. Request the paper you would like - be detailed - the colorplanpapers.com shows all the colours, embossings and weights they do for that range. The samples will have stickers on them which can be removed. 

Another source for paper is ebay. If buying reams of paper try searching on ebay first because you are likely to find it for very cheap. There are often business that are closing down who are trying to get rid of their stock. 

How will you bind the booklet?
Comb binding is an inexpensive binding technique which you can do for free in case room. There are various combs but if you would like to source them yourself ebay is the best place to find them. You can also perfect bind and saddle stitch for free in the case room. 

Consider how you might go about printing the booklet - digital, risograph, analogue printing techniques?
If printing multiple booklets the risograph is a good option. If digitalling printing there is a free printer in the postgraduate studio in the Haldane building, go early and late in the day. You can letterpress for free in the case room.
